      <section>
        <p>
          You've learned JavaScript. Maybe you took a course or read a book. You felt confident while following along. 
          But now there's silence. You open your editor with a blank stare. You feel lost. What now? 
          Learning to think like a developer is about breaking down problems into manageable chunks and building 
          solutions one step at a time.
        </p>

        <h2>The Disillusion of Tutorials</h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever watched a cooking show? The chef makes everything look easy. Behind the scenes, there's a team of 
          people who prepared ingredients, tested recipes, and styled the food. Tutorials can set similarly unrealistic 
          expectations. They give the false impression that the instructor knows everything instantly. In reality, 
          they've spent hours preparing, practicing, and sometimes even scripting the "spontaneous" problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don't be discouraged when your experience differs from what you see online. Everyone starts somewhere, and 
          building the developer mindset takes time and practice.
        </p>

        <h2>Breaking Down Problems</h2>
        <p>
          We often look at applications as incomprehensible black boxes. "I don't understand it, so I shouldn't bother." 
          But everything is just a sum of its parts. The key to thinking like a developer is breaking complex 
          problems into smaller, more manageable pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's take a simple Todo application as an example. It's a perfect learning project because it contains the 
          fundamental operations that make up nearly all software: Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Even massive 
          sites like Reddit, Instagram, or Twitter are essentially just sophisticated CRUD applications with extra 
          features.
        </p>



          <pre><code>// Instead of trying to build everything at once, 
// break the problem down into requirements:

// 1. Input field for the todo
// 2. Displaying the todos
// 3. Create todo
// 4. Update todo
// 5. Delete todo</code></pre>


        <h2>Thinking in Data Structures</h2>
        <p>
          A common struggle for new developers is visualizing how application state should be structured and manipulated. 
          It helps to model your application's data first before thinking about user interfaces or interactions.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// A simple data structure for todos
let todos = [
  {
    id: 1,
    text: "Learn JavaScript basics",
    completed: false,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "Build a todo app",
    completed: false,
  }
]</code></pre>

        <p>
          This approach gives you a "single source of truth" - a core concept in programming where your application's 
          state is maintained in one place, making it easier to reason about how data flows through your application.
        </p>

        <h2>Visualization Before Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Another effective technique is to visualize what you're building before writing any interactive code. 
          This gives you a reference point for what you're building toward:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div class="todos"&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li class="todo"&gt;
      &lt;input class="todo-checkbox" type="checkbox" /&gt;
      &lt;label class="todo-label"&gt;Learn JavaScript basics&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;button class="todo-edit"&gt;‚úèÔ∏è&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button class="todo-delete"&gt;‚ùå&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li class="todo"&gt;
      &lt;input class="todo-checkbox" type="checkbox" /&gt;
      &lt;label class="todo-label"&gt;Build a todo app&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;button class="todo-edit"&gt;‚úèÔ∏è&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button class="todo-delete"&gt;‚ùå&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

        <h2>Wishful Thinking</h2>
        <p>
          One powerful technique in programming is "wishful thinking" - writing code as if the functions you need 
          already exist, then implementing those functions later. This lets you focus on the high-level structure 
          before diving into details.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript">function addTodo() {
  // Check if input is empty
  // Create a todo object
  // Add it to the todos array
  // Update the UI
}

function updateTodo(id, newText) {
  // Find the todo with the matching id
  // Update its text
  // Update the UI
}

function deleteTodo(id) {
  // Filter out the todo with the matching id
  // Update the UI
}

function updateUI() {
  // Clear the input field
  // Generate HTML for all todos
  // Insert the HTML into the DOM
}</code></pre>

        <p>
          This approach is particularly useful when you're not sure how to implement a specific function yet. 
          It allows you to make progress on the overall structure while deferring complex details.
        </p>

        <h2>Pseudocode: Thinking Through Logic</h2>
        <p>
          Before writing actual code, it's often helpful to sketch out the logic using pseudocode - plain language 
          descriptions of what your code needs to do. This helps you reason through the logic without getting 
          caught up in syntax details.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Example pseudocode for adding a todo
function addTodo() {
  // If input is empty, do nothing and return
  // Create a new todo object with id, text, and completed status
  // Add the new todo to the todos array
  // Clear the input field
  // Update the todo list display
}</code></pre>

        <h2>Implementation: One Step at a Time</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we've broken down the problem and planned our approach, we can implement each piece 
          one at a time:
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Select DOM elements
const inputEl = document.querySelector('.todo-input');
const todoListEl = document.querySelector('.todos');

// Implement the add todo functionality
function addTodo() {
  if (!inputEl.value) return;
  
  const todo = {
    id: todos.length + 1,
    text: inputEl.value,
    completed: false
  };
  
  todos.push(todo);
  updateUI();
}

// Add event listener for the Enter key
inputEl.addEventListener('keypress', (event) => {
  if (event.key === 'Enter') {
    addTodo();
  }
});</code></pre>

        <p>
          By implementing one small piece at a time and testing frequently, you build confidence and maintain a clear 
          understanding of how each part contributes to the whole.
        </p>

        <h2>Active Problem Solving</h2>
        <p>
          When you encounter a problem or don't know how to implement something, resist the urge to immediately 
          watch another tutorial. Instead:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            Define the specific problem you're trying to solve (e.g., "How do I get the value from an input field?")
          </li>
          <li>
            Search for specific solutions using keywords (e.g., "JavaScript input value")
          </li>
          <li>
            Test solutions in isolation before integrating them into your project
          </li>
          <li>
            Use console.log() liberally to understand what your code is doing
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          This active problem-solving approach builds skills that tutorials alone cannot provide. It's how real 
          developers work every day.
        </p>

        <h2>Learning from Documentation</h2>
        <p>
          Many new developers avoid reading documentation, finding it intimidating or confusing. However, learning to 
          navigate documentation is an essential developer skill. Start with resources like MDN Web Docs for JavaScript,
          which provide both technical details and practical examples.
        </p>

        <p>
          When documentation isn't helpful, look at real code on GitHub. Quality projects often include example code
          that demonstrates how to use their features.
        </p>

        <h2>Working Code First, Clean Code Later</h2>
        <p>
          It's tempting to worry about writing "clean" or "proper" code from the start. Don't. Focus on making your 
          code work first, then refactor and improve it. Even experienced developers write messy code initially and 
          clean it up later.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-javascript">// First version: Make it work
function deleteTodo(id) {
  const newTodos = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < todos.length; i++) {
    if (todos[i].id !== id) {
      newTodos.push(todos[i]);
    }
  }
  todos = newTodos;
  updateUI();
}

// Refactored version: Make it cleaner
function deleteTodo(id) {
  todos = todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id);
  updateUI();
}</code></pre>

        <h2>Practice Makes Progress</h2>
        <p>
          Don't expect to understand something just because you watched or read about it once. Real learning comes from 
          doing - making mistakes, fixing them, and building understanding through experience.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Instead of practicing syntax (which you can always look up), practice the mental process of breaking down 
          problems, planning solutions, and implementing them step by step. Your specific code may look different from 
          someone else's, but if it works, that's a success!
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Thinking like a developer is a skill that develops with practice. It's about breaking complex tasks into 
          manageable pieces, planning before coding, using appropriate data structures, and solving problems 
          systematically.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Remember that even the most complicated applications start with a single line of code. Don't be intimidated 
          by complexity - embrace it as a puzzle to be solved one piece at a time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          In my next post, I'll explore how to expand on these fundamentals by adding features like filtering, 
          persistent storage, and improved UI to our todo application. Stay tuned!
